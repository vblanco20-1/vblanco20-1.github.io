Gameplay and AI programmer at Stompy Bot, for the Heavy Gear Assault project.
Made the bot AI, and some generic gameplay and multiplayer programming tasks, using UE4 and C++.

The bots in Heavy Gear Assault have the same capabilities as a player, and unlock new abilities when they increase in difficulty. The easiest bot does not run and just shoots with a low accuracy. Higher difficulty bots can circle-strafe the player using the rollers, aim their shots with prediction, and even perform dodges to avoid player shots. Bots can react to player commands if they are teammates, and they are aware of team tactics through the use of a Team Commander AI wich gives orders to the normal bots in the match.
